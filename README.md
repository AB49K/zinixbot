# zinixbot
An IRC bot unixbird and I made for #linuxmasterrace.

### Commands:

__.distro__ _arg_

Outputs the link to a random distro on distrowatch or the link to _arg_, providing _arg_ is a real distro.

__Arch spam__

On (which|what) (distro|distribution) (should|best| use), the bot will spam the word 'Arch'.

__.test__

A simple test function which outputs 'Hello World!'

__.highfive__ _arg_

Sends /me highfives _arg_, or if no _arg_ is passed, the name of the invoking user.

__.spock__

Another simple function, you will see a few of these. This one outputs 'live long and prosper!'

__.hisname__

JOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHN CEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

__.peasantry__

bite my shiny gnu ass!

__.linus__

Back to functions with a somewhat real purpose: this one outputs Linus Torvald's famous introductory speech to the Linux kernel.

__.dank, .dankmeme, .dankswag, .doritotini__

Variations of eachother, all output dank maymays.

__.interject__

Outputs the first couple lines of the famous "I'd like to interject..." speech.

__.rekt__

Outputs one of ~70 random phrases with 'rekt' in it.

__.shrug__

Outputs the shrug text emote, for when you just don't know.

Used to get a tally of all the bots in the channel, each with a unique catchphrase.

__.aids__

Windows command prompt is in any way functional.

__.zroll__ _arg_

A custom dice roll from a bot that doesn't hate me. _arg_ should be in the form of <num1>d<num2> or d<num2>, where <num1> is number of times to roll, and <num2> is the size of the dice to roll. Results are random.

__.rswitch__ _on/off_

Used to toggle zrolling.
